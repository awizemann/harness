# Build and Run

How to build Harness from source.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | How to install |
|---|---|
| macOS 14+ | System update |
| Xcode 16+ (Xcode 26 recommended) | App Store / Apple Developer |
| Command Line Tools | `xcode-select --install` |
| Homebrew | https://brew.sh |
| `xcodegen` | `brew install xcodegen` — used to generate `Harness.xcodeproj` from `project.yml` |
| Anthropic API key | https://console.anthropic.com — added via the first-run wizard; for headless dev, set via `security add-generic-password -s com.harness.anthropic -a default -w <key>` |

Harness drives the simulator via WebDriverAgent, which is vendored as a git submodule under `vendor/WebDriverAgent`. After cloning:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The WDA runner is built on first use against the iOS version of the simulator you pick (~1–2 min) and cached under `~/Library/Application Support/Harness/wda-build/iOS-<ver>/` for reuse.

The first-run wizard (Phase 3) checks all of the above on launch and surfaces actionable errors with copy-pasteable install commands when something's missing.

## One-time setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url> harness
cd harness
xcodegen generate
open Harness.xcodeproj
```

`project.yml` is the source of truth for project structure; `Harness.xcodeproj` is regenerated from it. **Don't hand-edit `Harness.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`** — those edits won't survive the next `xcodegen generate`. Add files / change settings via `project.yml`.

## Build

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project Harness.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Harness \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  build
```

Or open `Harness.xcodeproj` in Xcode and ⌘R.

The first build takes ~15s. Subsequent builds are sub-second thanks to incremental compilation.

## Test

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project Harness.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Harness \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  test
```

Tests cover: HarnessPaths math, ProcessRunner cancellation + streaming, KeychainStore round-trip, SimulatorDriver coordinate scaling + simctl JSON parsing, AgentTools schema invariants, WDABuilder version-key normalization, WDAClient request shapes (URLProtocol-mocked), WDARunner xcodebuild invocation shape, and end-to-end RunCoordinator replay via fakes. ~105 tests, runs in <3s.

Simulator-integration tests (full sim boot + screenshot + WDA round-trip) are gated behind a `requiresSimulator` tag — opt in via `-only-testing:HarnessTests/RequiresSim/...`.

## Run against a sample app

Available Phase 3 — once the agent loop is wired and the goal-input UI is built:

1. Open Harness.
2. ⌘N (New Run).
3. Pick an Xcode project (e.g., the in-tree `samples/TodoSample.xcodeproj` once it exists).
4. Pick a scheme.
5. Pick a simulator.
6. Pick or write a persona ("first-time user, never seen this app").
7. Write a goal ("I want to add 'milk' to my list and mark it as done.").
8. Pick mode (Step-by-step recommended for first runs).
9. Click Start.

Watch the live mirror; approve actions in step mode (Space). After the run, the replay opens automatically.

## Adding files to the project

1. Drop the file into `Harness/<Subdir>/` or `HarnessDesign/<Subdir>/`.
2. Run `xcodegen generate`.
3. Rebuild.

The project uses Xcode's modern file-system-synchronized groups (via xcodegen's `path:` directives), so no manual project file editing is needed.

## Common errors

| Error | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "xcodegen: command not found" | Tooling not installed | `brew install xcodegen` |
| "WebDriverAgent source not found" | Submodule not initialized | `git submodule update --init --recursive` from the repo root |
| "WebDriverAgent did not become ready" | First WDA build still compiling, or xcodebuild test runner crashed | Wait ~1–2 min on first run; check the `build.log` under the WDA cache dir |
| "Failed to boot simulator" | Sim already booted in Xcode and grabbing focus | Quit Simulator.app, retry — though `SimulatorDriver.boot` is idempotent and tolerates the already-booted state |
| "Build failed: signing required" | Project's xcconfig requires a dev team | `XcodeBuilder` passes `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` and surfaces a typed `BuildFailure.signingRequired`. See [Xcode-Builder](Xcode-Builder.md). |
| "Authentication failed" from Claude | API key bad/expired or absent | Settings → API Key (Phase 3) or `security add-generic-password -s com.harness.anthropic -a default -w <key>` for Phase 1 dev |
| Test target fails to build with "ambiguous type lookup" | Naming collision between Harness and HarnessDesign — most likely your new type collides with a `Preview*` placeholder | Rename the placeholder, not the production type. See `HarnessDesign/Mocks/PreviewData.swift` for examples. |

# 14 — Run Logging Format

Applies to: **Harness**

The on-disk format for run artifacts. Pairs with `08-run-log-integrity.md` (write/read invariants) and [Run-Replay-Format](https://github.com/awizemann/harness/wiki/Run-Replay-Format) (human-facing reference).

---

## 1. Files per run

```
<App Support>/Harness/runs/<run-id>/
├── events.jsonl          append-only event stream
├── meta.json             redundant copy of RunRecord fields (offline-portable)
├── step-001.png          screenshots (3-digit zero-padded)
├── step-002.png
├── …
└── build/                xcodebuild derived data (kept for reproducibility)
    └── DerivedData-<run-id>/
```

`<run-id>` is a UUID. Every path under the run dir is portable — copy or zip the directory and replay it on another machine.

---

## 2. JSONL row schema

Every row is a complete JSON object on a single line. Common fields on every row:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | int | yes | `3` today (V5 — credential metadata on `run_started`, `fill_credential` tool inputs). Bumps only on backward-incompatible change. v1 (pre-Phase-E) and v2 logs stay readable — see §5. |
| `runId` | string (UUID) | yes | Constant across the whole file. |
| `ts` | string (ISO 8601, UTC) | yes | `2026-05-03T19:14:22.118Z` |
| `kind` | string | yes | One of the enum below. |

Unknown fields are tolerated by the parser. Adding new optional fields is forward-compatible.

## 3. Row kinds

### `run_started`

First row in the file. Carries the run setup.

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "runId": "B8C5A8F1-…",
  "ts": "2026-05-03T19:14:22.118Z",
  "kind": "run_started",
  "goal": "I want to keep track of things to buy. Try to add 'milk' to my list and mark it as done.",
  "persona": "first-time user, never seen this app",
  "model": "claude-opus-4-7",
  "mode": "stepByStep",                       // or "autonomous"
  "stepBudget": 40,                           // 0 = unlimited; the run is gated only by the token budget + cycle detector
  "tokenBudget": 250000,                      // resolved at run-build time: per-run override → AppState override → per-model default, clamped to AgentModel.maxTokenBudget
  "project": {
    "path": "/Users/alanwizemann/Development/TodoSample",
    "scheme": "TodoSample",
    "displayName": "TodoSample"
  },
  "simulator": {
    "udid": "B8C5A8F1-…",
    "name": "iPhone 16 Pro",
    "runtime": "iOS 18.4",
    "pointWidth": 430,
    "pointHeight": 932,
    "scaleFactor": 3.0
  }
}
```

### `leg_started` *(v2)*

One per chain leg, before that leg's first `step_started`. Single-action runs still emit one `leg_started` (with `leg: 0`, `actionName: ""`) so every run has at least one leg in the log — replay code never special-cases zero legs.

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 2, "runId": "...", "ts": "...",
  "kind": "leg_started",
  "leg": 0,
  "actionName": "Add 'milk' to my list",
  "goal": "I want to add 'milk' to the list and mark it done.",
  "preservesState": false
}
```

### `leg_completed` *(v2)*

Paired with the most recent `leg_started`. Emitted when the agent calls `mark_goal_done` for that leg, or when the chain executor synthesizes a `skipped` verdict for a leg that never ran (because an earlier leg failed/blocked).

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 2, "runId": "...", "ts": "...",
  "kind": "leg_completed",
  "leg": 1,
  "verdict": "success",                  // "success" | "failure" | "blocked" | "skipped"
  "summary": "Marked 'milk' done."
}
```

### `step_started`

One per step, before any tool call. References the screenshot taken at the top of the iteration.

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1, "runId": "...", "ts": "...",
  "kind": "step_started",
  "step": 3,
  "screenshot": "step-003.png",                // relative path
  "tokensUsedSoFar": 14820
}
```

### `tool_call`

The tool the agent emitted on this step. Reasoning fields included.

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1, "runId": "...", "ts": "...",
  "kind": "tool_call",
  "step": 3,
  "tool": "tap",
  "input": { "x": 215, "y": 482 },
  "observation": "I see a centered + button at the bottom of the list.",
  "intent": "I'll tap it to open the new-todo input."
}
```

The `input` schema varies by `tool`. See [Tool-Schema](https://github.com/awizemann/harness/wiki/Tool-Schema) for each tool's payload.

### `tool_result`

Paired with the most recent `tool_call` for this step. Captures execution outcome.

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1, "runId": "...", "ts": "...",
  "kind": "tool_result",
  "step": 3,
  "tool": "tap",
  "success": true,
  "duration_ms": 47,
  "error": null
}
```

If the user rejected (step mode) or skipped:

```jsonc
{ "kind": "tool_result", "step": 3, "tool": "tap", "success": false, "userDecision": "rejected", "userNote": "the + is below — it shouldn't be in the corner" }
```

### `friction`

Emitted when the agent calls `note_friction` or when the loop synthesizes one.

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1, "runId": "...", "ts": "...",
  "kind": "friction",
  "step": 3,
  "frictionKind": "ambiguous_label",
  "detail": "The button just says 'Go' — I'm not sure what it does until I tap it."
}
```

The `frictionKind` values are the taxonomy from `13-agent-loop.md §5` plus the synthesized `agent_blocked`.

### `step_completed`

Emitted after the tool sequence resolves (one tool_call → one tool_result, plus any friction rows).

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1, "runId": "...", "ts": "...",
  "kind": "step_completed",
  "step": 3,
  "durationMs": 4218,
  "tokensThisStep": { "input": 4820, "output": 311 }
}
```

### `run_completed`

Last row in the file. Carries the verdict.

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1, "runId": "...", "ts": "...",
  "kind": "run_completed",
  "verdict": "success",                         // "success" | "failure" | "blocked"
  "summary": "Added 'milk' via the + button, tapped the row to mark it done. Saw a checkmark.",
  "frictionCount": 2,
  "wouldRealUserSucceed": true,
  "stepCount": 9,
  "tokensUsedTotal": { "input": 41280, "output": 2104 }
}
```

If the run crashed mid-flight, `run_completed` is absent. The parser detects this and surfaces the run as "incomplete" in the history view.

---

## 4. meta.json

A redundant snapshot of the `RunRecord` SwiftData fields written at run end. Lets a copied run directory replay without the SwiftData index:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "B8C5A8F1-…",
  "createdAt": "2026-05-03T19:14:22.118Z",
  "completedAt": "2026-05-03T19:18:04.005Z",
  "verdict": "success",
  "frictionCount": 2,
  "stepCount": 9,
  "tokensUsedInput": 41280,
  "tokensUsedOutput": 2104,
  "model": "claude-opus-4-7",
  "mode": "stepByStep",
  "goal": "...",
  "persona": "...",
  "projectPath": "/Users/alanwizemann/Development/TodoSample",
  "scheme": "TodoSample",
  "simulator": { "udid": "...", "name": "iPhone 16 Pro", "runtime": "iOS 18.4" }
}
```

## 5. Versioning rules

- Adding an optional field → no version bump.
- Adding a new `kind` → no version bump (parsers must tolerate unknown kinds; warn, don't fail).
- Renaming, removing, or retyping a required field → version bump. Versioned decoders ship side-by-side; old runs stay readable forever.

When `schemaVersion` bumps:

1. Add a new versioned decoder.
2. Keep the old one. Don't migrate on disk.
3. Update [Run-Replay-Format](https://github.com/awizemann/harness/wiki/Run-Replay-Format) to document both versions.
4. Update the round-trip test (`Tests/HarnessTests/RunLoggerRoundTripTests.swift`) to cover the new version while keeping the old version's fixture green.

### v1 → v2 reader migration *(Phase E)*

v1 logs (pre-Phase-E) carry **no** leg rows. The parser handles this transparently:

- `RunLogParser.parse(...)` accepts `schemaVersion: 1`, `2`, and `3` rows. Anything else throws `schemaVersionUnsupported`.
- `RunLogParser.legViews(from:)` synthesizes a single virtual leg around all step rows when no `leg_started` row appears in the log. Downstream views (replay timeline, friction sectioning, `RunRecord.legs`) therefore treat every run as having ≥1 leg without conditionals.
- The on-disk format is **never** rewritten. v1 logs stay byte-identical; only readers know about the migration.
- New runs always emit v2 — even single-action runs (one synthetic `leg_started`/`leg_completed` pair around the step rows).

### v2 → v3 reader migration *(V5 — credential support)*

v3 introduces two additive changes:

- **`run_started` payload** gains optional `credentialLabel` and `credentialUsername` fields. v2 logs decode cleanly via `decodeIfPresent` — historical runs simply don't surface a credential identity.
- **`fill_credential` tool calls** appear in `tool_call` rows with `input: {"field": "username" | "password"}`. v2 logs never carry this tool kind (the agent didn't have it).

### Credential redaction *(v3 invariants — never weaken)*

Three guarantees the run-log format enforces:

1. **No password in the JSONL.** The `tool_call.input` shape for `fill_credential` is exactly `{"field": "username"}` or `{"field": "password"}`. The actual value is intentionally absent. The driver synthesises the typed text from a `CredentialBinding` it caches in memory and never serialises.
2. **No password in the system prompt.** The `{{CREDENTIALS}}` block injected into the system prompt lists `label + username` only — even when a credential is staged. The agent is told the field exists and how to invoke `fill_credential`, but never sees the password value.
3. **Screenshots rely on platform secure-text-entry.** iOS `SecureField`, macOS `NSSecureTextField`, and HTML `<input type="password">` all mask the value visually. We accept that an unusual SUT that doesn't use secure-text-entry could leak a password into a captured PNG. Document this on the run-creation surface; don't claim guarantees we can't enforce.

A grep over a run's `events.jsonl` for any password value should return zero hits. The audit checklist in §8 includes a check for this.

## 6. Screenshot conventions

- PNG, simulator native resolution (no downscaling on disk — downscaling happens only when sending to Claude).
- Filename: `step-NNN.png` with N zero-padded to 3 digits. Steps beyond 999 are out of scope (hard ceiling is 200).
- The PNG is written **before** the `step_started` row that references it. If the PNG write fails, no `step_started` is emitted; the loop fails the step and emits a `friction` of kind `unexpected_state`.
- **No agent scaffolding on disk.** Overlays the agent uses for targeting (the web driver's Set-of-Mark numbered badges, future iOS / macOS equivalents) are drawn on an in-memory copy only and routed to Claude via `ScreenshotMetadata.markedImageData`. The on-disk PNG always shows the clean rendered page — replay, friction reports, and exported screenshots stay free of dev-tool clutter.

---

## 7. Replay invariants

A correctly-formed run satisfies:

- `run_started` is the first row.
- For every `step_started`, exactly one `tool_call` and at most one `tool_result` exist with the same `step`.
- `step_completed` appears once per step, after that step's `tool_result`.
- If `run_completed` appears, it is the last row.
- Step numbers are 1-indexed, monotonically increasing, no gaps.
- Every `screenshot` field references a file that exists in the run directory.

Replay parsers verify these on load and surface specific errors when violated.

---

## 8. Audit checklist

When reviewing run-log code:

- [ ] Does `RunLogger` write `schemaVersion: 1` on every row?
- [ ] Are reasoning fields (`observation`, `intent`) preserved verbatim from the model?
- [ ] Does `step_started` reference a screenshot file that already exists at write time?
- [ ] Is `meta.json` written at run end (success or failure path)?
- [ ] Does the parser tolerate unknown `kind` values without crashing?
- [ ] Does the round-trip test exercise every kind?
- [ ] Are timestamps ISO 8601 with `Z` suffix (UTC), not local time?
